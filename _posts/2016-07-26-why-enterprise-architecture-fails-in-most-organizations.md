# Why Enterprise Architecture Fails in Most Organizations

The greatest issues surrounding enterprise architecture (EA) is that a lot of effort is spent producing artifacts: the reference architectures, application landscapes, standards etc... that in the end, few IT stakeholders utilize nor understand. Consequently, the work is not done to align both IT and the business to the EA outputs. And often, when clear outcomes take a long time to produce, the function itself is ridiculed as useless.

I read Ted Keiffer's _(Director of Enterprise Architecture, Walmart)_ post on [Just-In-Time Enterprise Architecture][0] and Ambysoft's [Agile Enterprise Architecture][1] and I agree in principle with what they wrote.

## My key issues with enterprise architecture:

* It competes with Business Relationship Management as a way of interacting with the business, blurring the boundaries and causing confusion.
* In practice, it becomes too technical for business stakeholders and too abstract for IT stakeholders. Moreover, there's not enough evangelism or marketing about it throughout the organization for it to be successful. Thus people don't follow it.
* There is a sense that the entire organization needs to be mapped before we can realize any value. This is particularly true when it comes to the data architecture because so much of it interacts throughout organizational processes.
* When it comes to technology, EA focuses on technologies that are existing and well-known. It's unclear how EA works to generate innovation and new ways of working since it's primarily mapping existing or desired capabilities. However, if a new innovation comes (such as enterprise social networks), it's unclear how enterprise architecture would have mapped that technological need.
* There isn't enough IT resources to enact all the findings from EA.

There will never be enough resources dedicated to properly fund an EA function, as it is not seen as operation-critical. Thus enterprise architects can never fully realize their vision and we must find ways to make the best of EA with insufficient resourcing.

## We can improve enterprise architecture in the following ways:

**Focus on the business.** Start by solving the problems of the business stakeholders before solving the IT problems and focus on creating relationships with the business.

* PROS: This approach focuses on creating value for the business.
* CONS: This means moving away from creating standards and enacting application rationalization that IT people want and look for from enterprise architecture.

**Be just-in-time.** Create an overview of the enterprise, but branch down and iterate as the business or IT needs it.

* PROS: This means that we don't have any set of artifacts that will not be used.
* CONS: This also means incomplete connections and interactions, meaning that our answers may not be accurate.

**Enterprise architectures need to be a relation-based job.** It must be the interface between giving technology solutions to improve the business and providing technology references and standards for the IT organization. But it needs to be focused on the one hand on conferring with business and on the other hand with discussing with IT how to proceed. Creating artifacts and documents should be an intermediate step to come up with solutions that satisfy both the business and IT.
